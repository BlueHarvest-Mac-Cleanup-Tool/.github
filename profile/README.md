## What is BlueHarvest for Mac?

BlueHarvest for Mac is a specialized utility application that automatically finds and removes hidden macOS service files, such as `.DS_Store` and `__MACOSX` folders, from your disks and external drives. These files are created by the macOS Finder and can cause clutter, compatibility issues when sharing files with Windows or Linux systems, and consume valuable storage space over time.

The application runs efficiently in the background, integrating seamlessly with your workflow. You can set it to clean specific folders or entire drives automatically upon connection. This ensures that your storage remains optimized and that files transferred to other operating systems are clean and professional-looking. BlueHarvest is an indispensable tool for developers, designers, and anyone who frequently shares files across different platforms.
